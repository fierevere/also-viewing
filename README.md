# WordPress.org Also Viewing

## About the project

This is a userscript, used with TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey, used to avoid overlapping replies on WordPress.org.

The script provides a small bar, showing you what other script uers are viewing (or typing) in a given topic.

This is done to avoid overlapping replies, which can be confusing to end users, and in some cases come off as noisy or spammy.


## Installation

To install, open `/src/alsoviewing.user.js` and hit the Raw button. TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey will take over from there.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, bugreports, suggestions and even pull requests! No limitations, shoot for the stars!

The project uses no fancy build procedures, it's all JavaScript and the source is in the `src/` directory
